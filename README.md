# NetworkNotification
System tray icon that shows network activity. Indicates incoming and outcoming network traffic, similar to the pre-Windows 7 tray icon.

To install the programme download the file:

NetworkNotification/NetworkNotification/bin/Release/NetworkNotification.exe

And save it to your Windows folder:

%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup


This way the tray icon will show every time you start Windows. (Depending on your Windows security settings you might need to allow it to run.)
